# Kubernetes DISA/STIG Compliance

**In development**

Core Contributors: [Andrew Bond](https://github.com/aabond) and [Michael Ward](https://github.com/mward29)

`k8s-fortified` is a test suite for Kubernetes compliance with DISA Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG).

A full list of STIGs for Kubernetes can be found at [Cyber Tracker Live](https://cyber.trackr.live/stig/Kubernetes_STIG/1/0).
Their work has been a boon to this project.



**Future:**
  - Enable across all OS distributions: Single OS use case is bad, set it up for any OS.
  - Automate test generation: the bulk of tests were written manually. We would like to automate this to reduce maintenance.
  - Dynamic configuration: Static fields are bad. Make the easily configurable.
