    stig_description: |
      To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DoD-approved PKIs, all DoD systems (e.g., networks, web servers, and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset.

      Node,RBAC is the method within Kubernetes to control access of users and applications. Kubernetes uses roles to grant authorization API requests made by kubelets.

      By default, the API server will listen on two ports and addresses. One address is the secure address and the other address is called the 'insecure bind' address and is set by default to localhost. Any requests to this address bypass authentication and authorization checks. If this insecure bind address is set to localhost, anyone who gains access to the host on which the master is running can bypass all authorization and authentication mechanisms put in place and have full control over the entire cluster.

      Close or set the insecure bind address by setting the API server's --insecure-bind-address flag to an IP or leave it unset and ensure that the --insecure-bind-port is not set.

      One of the tools heavily used to interact with containers in the Kubernetes cluster is kubectl. The command is the tool System Administrators used to create, modify, and delete resources. One of the capabilities of the tool is to copy files to and from running containers (i.e., kubectl cp). The command uses the 'tar' command of the container to copy files from the container to the host executing the 'kubectl cp' command. If the 'tar' command on the container has been replaced by a malicious user, the command can copy files anywhere on the host machine. This flaw has been fixed in later versions of the tool. It is recommended to use kubectl versions newer than 1.12.9.

The audit data can be protected through audit log file protections and user authorization.

      One way for an attacker to thwart these measures is to send the audit logs to another source and filter the audited results before sending them on to the original target. This can be done in Kubernetes through the configuration of dynamic audit webhooks through the DynamicAuditing flag.

    stig_description: |
      When Kubernetes is started, components and user services are started for auditing startup events, and events for components and services, it is important that auditing begin on startup. Within Kubernetes, audit data for all components is generated by the API server. To enable auditing to begin, an audit policy must be defined for the events and the information to be stored with each event. It is also necessary to give a secure location where the audit logs are to be stored. If an audit log path is not specified, all audit data is sent to studio.

    stig_description: |
      Within Kubernetes, audit data for all components is generated by the API server. This audit data is important when there are issues, to include security incidents that must be investigated. To make the audit data worthwhile for the investigation of events, it is necessary to have the appropriate and required data logged. To fully understand the event, it is important to identify any users associated with the event. 

      The API server policy file allows for the following levels of auditing:
            None - Do not log events that match the rule.
            Metadata - Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but not request or response body.
            Request - Log event metadata and request body but not response body.
            RequestResponse - Log event metadata, request, and response bodies.

      Kubernetes allows for the overriding of hostnames. Allowing this feature to be implemented within the kubelets may break the TLS setup between the kubelet service and the API server.

      Privileged ports are those ports below 1024 and that require system privileges for their use. If containers can use these ports, the container must be run as a privileged user. Kubernetes must stop containers that try to map to these ports directly. Allowing non-privileged ports to be mapped to the container-privileged port is the allowable method when a certain port is needed. An example is mapping port 8080 externally to port 80 in the container.

      Kubernetes container and pod configuration are maintained by Kubelet. Kubelet agents register nodes with the API Server, mount volume storage, and perform health checks for containers and pods. Anyone who gains access to Kubelet agents can effectively control applications within the pods and containers. Using authenticity protection, the communication can be protected against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.

      The communication session is protected by utilizing transport encryption protocols, such as TLS. TLS provides the Kubernetes API Server with a means to be able to authenticate sessions and encrypt traffic.

      To enable encrypted communication for Kubelet, the parameter etcd-cafile must be set. This parameter gives the location of the SSL Certificate Authority file used to secure Kubelet communication.

      Kubernetes uses the API Server to control communication to the other services that makeup Kubernetes. The use of authorizations and not the default of 'AlwaysAllow' enables the Kubernetes functions control to only the groups that need them.

      To control access the API server must have one of the following options set for the authorization mode:
          --authorization-mode=ABAC Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) mode allows a user to configure policies using local files.
          --authorization-mode=RBAC Role-based access control (RBAC) mode allows a user to create and store policies using the Kubernetes API.
          --authorization-mode=Webhook
       
      WebHook is an HTTP callback mode that allows a user to manage authorization using a remote REST endpoint.
          --authorization-mode=Node

      Node authorization is a special-purpose authorization mode that specifically authorizes API requests made by kubelets.
          --authorization-mode=AlwaysDeny 

      This flag blocks all requests. Use this flag only for testing.

      Satisfies: SRG-APP-000340-CTR-000770, SRG-APP-000033-CTR-000095, SRG-APP-000378-CTR-000880

      Enabling the admissions webhook allows for Kubernetes to apply policies against objects that are to be created, read, updated, or deleted. By applying a pod security policy, control can be given to not allow images to be instantiated that run as the root user. If pods run as the root user, the pod then has root privileges to the host system and all the resources it has. An attacker can use this to attack the Kubernetes cluster. By implementing a policy that does not allow root or privileged pods, the pod users are limited in what the pod can do and access.

    stig_title: Kubernetes must have a pod security policy set.
    stig_description: |
      Enabling the admissions webhook allows for Kubernetes to apply policies against objects that are to be created, read, updated, or deleted. By applying a pod security policy, control can be given to not allow images to be instantiated that run as the root user. If pods run as the root user, the pod then has root privileges to the host system and all the resources it has. An attacker can use this to attack the Kubernetes cluster. By implementing a policy that does not allow root or privileged pods, the pod users are limited in what the pod can do and access.

    stig_description: |
      Kubernetes control plane and external communication is managed by API Server. The main implementation of the API Server is to manage hardware resources for pods and container using horizontal or vertical scaling. Anyone who can gain access to the API Server can effectively control your Kubernetes architecture. Using authenticity protection, the communication can be protected against man-in-the-middle attacks/session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions.

      The communication session is protected by utilizing transport encryption protocols, such as TLS. TLS provides the Kubernetes API Server with a means to be able to authenticate sessions and encrypt traffic.

      By default, the API Server does not authenticate to the kubelet HTTPs endpoint. To enable secure communication for API Server, the parameter -kubelet-client-certificate and kubelet-client-key must be set. This parameter gives the location of the certificate and key pair used to secure API Server communication.

    stig_description: |
      Kubernetes software must stay up to date with the latest patches, service packs, and hot fixes. Not updating the Kubernetes control plane will expose the organization to vulnerabilities.

      Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously. 

      Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant container platform components may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). 

      This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the IAVM process.

      The container platform components will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The container platform registry will ensure the images are current. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).

      The Kubernetes API Server will prohibit the use of SSL and unauthorized versions of TLS protocols to properly secure communication.

      The use of unsupported protocol exposes vulnerabilities to Kubernetes by rogue traffic interceptions, man-in-the middle attacks, and impersonation of users or services from the container platform runtime, registry, and keystore. To enable the minimum version of TLS to be used by the Kubernetes API Server, the setting 'tls-min-version' must be set.

      The container platform and its components will adhere to NIST 800-52R2.
